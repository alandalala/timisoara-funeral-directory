Comprehensive Analysis of Romania's Administrative-Territorial Architecture: A Detailed Report on Counties and Urban Centers
1. Introduction to the Administrative Framework of Romania
The administrative-territorial organization of Romania is a unitary system rooted in deep historical traditions, yet continuously adapting to modern European standards of governance and statistical classification. The fundamental unit of administration is the County (Județ), a designation that traces its etymological and functional origins to the medieval principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia.1 This system was formally reintroduced in 1968, replacing the Soviet-inspired administrative divisions of "regions" and "raions," to better reflect the nation's historical continuity and to facilitate more efficient local governance.
Currently, the Romanian state is partitioned into 41 counties and the Municipality of Bucharest, the latter possessing a special administrative status equivalent to that of a county.1 These 42 entities serve as the NUTS-3 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) level subdivisions within the European Union framework, playing a critical role in the allocation of structural funds, regional development planning, and the implementation of national public policies.
1.1 The Hierarchy of Urban Settlements
Within the county framework, urban settlements are classified into two distinct legal categories based on their size, economic importance, and level of urbanization:
Municipality (Municipiu): This status is granted to larger urban centers that play a significant economic, social, political, and cultural role at the county or regional level. Municipalities typically have larger populations—often exceeding 15,000 to 20,000 inhabitants—and possess a higher degree of urbanization and infrastructure development compared to towns. They enjoy greater autonomy in fiscal matters and are often the engines of local economies.3
Town (Oraș): This classification applies to settlements of local importance. Towns act as administrative and commercial hubs for the surrounding rural areas (communes). While they function as urban centers, many smaller towns still retain certain rural characteristics, particularly in terms of their economic reliance on agriculture or primary resource extraction.3
As of the most recent administrative updates, there are 320 cities and towns in Romania, comprising 103 municipalities and 217 towns.5 This report provides an exhaustive analysis of these units, organized by Romania's eight development regions (NUTS-2), to offer a coherent narrative of the country's internal geography, demographic shifts, and economic profiles.
2. The North-East Development Region
The North-East Development Region corresponds largely to the northern half of the historical principality of Moldavia (including Bucovina). It is the most populous region in Romania, characterized by a stark duality: it hosts some of the nation's most culturally rich and historically significant sites (such as the UNESCO-listed Painted Monasteries) but also faces profound economic challenges, including the lowest GDP per capita in the country and high rates of rural poverty and emigration.6
2.1 Bacău County (Județul Bacău)
Located on the eastern foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, Bacău County serves as a vital transportation and industrial corridor connecting Moldavia with Transylvania via the Oituz Pass. The county's geography is defined by the Siret and Bistrița river valleys, which have facilitated the development of a robust hydroelectric chain and industrial infrastructure.7

Population: ~601,387 (County total) 5
Area: 6,621 km² 5

2.2 Botoșani County (Județul Botoșani)
Situated in the extreme north-eastern corner of Romania, bordering Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova, Botoșani is predominantly an agricultural county characterized by rolling plains and rich chernozem soils. Despite its economic isolation, it is a cultural heavyweight, being the birthplace of national poet Mihai Eminescu, composer George Enescu, and historian Nicolae Iorga.6

Abbreviation: BT
Population: ~392,821 5

10. Conclusion
The administrative landscape of Romania reveals a nation in transition. The county (județ) system, while providing a stable framework for over 50 years, now encompasses regions moving at vastly different speeds. The "Tier 1" counties—Cluj, Timiș, Iași, Constanța, and Ilfov—are decoupling from the national average, driven by university ecosystems, IT services, and superior connectivity. Conversely, counties like Teleorman, Vaslui, and Mehedinți face the existential threat of depopulation and deindustrialization.
The urban network mirrors this polarization. While municipalities like Cluj-Napoca and Oradea have reinvented themselves as European mid-sized cities, smaller mono-industrial towns (e.g., in the Jiu Valley or the Bărăgan plain) struggle to define their role in a market economy. Understanding this list of counties and cities is therefore not merely an exercise in geography, but a reading of Romania's economic past, present, and future potential.
